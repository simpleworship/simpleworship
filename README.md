# Simple Worship

Simple worship is an app who's goal is to provide a simple replacement for many of the popular presentation software offerings available to Churches today.

## Why Simple Worship?

I have a firm believe that worship should not be an entertainment event, but should instead be focused on God -- and as such any displays used should mainly be used for reference material, _not_ for entertainment value.

- No flashing lights.
- No smoke machines.
- Just solid reference materials.

## Motivation

At my church, we have moved through a few different available options over the years, but we never end up using 90% of the features -- as all of our "slides" tend to just be white text on a black background. While I don't have any issues with companies selling products to Churches, I feel like most of this software is heavily targeting people putting on entertainment events, and not actual churches.

With all the fancy features comes complexity and pain on the part of the person who actually has to use the software. I want it to be _Simple_.

## Features

My end goal is to provide the following "slide" types:

- Songs, with defined parts and song order.
  - The goal is to be able to define all the lyrics to a song, and then define a parts order, and the software will automatically display the lyrics in the order defined.
- Bible Reference
  - Define a verse and version, and automatically generate the slides using a bible API (tbd)
- Generic Text
  - Useful for administration tasks like announcements.
- Embed
  - Display embeded content -- Mainly useful for Videos that might want to be shown (ex: Mission Trip highlights)
- Default Screen
  - Display a "default" screen that can be used when no other slides are being shown (example: church's logo, or name, or just a black screen)
