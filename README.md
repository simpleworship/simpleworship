# Simple Worship

A wails / React based application for in-church display.

This software is still in active development, and is not yet ready for production use.

The end goal here  is a simple, easy to use, and free church presentation software that is cheap to deploy, pluggable for easy extensibility, and easy to use for volunteers to might not be as tech savvy.

## Our Motivation

This project was started for two main reasons:

- We were tired of walled garden, proprietary and hard to interact with software for churches.
  - As the "technology people" at our churches, we want to be able to automate and simplify workflows, and make it extremely easy for volenteers to
    use the software.
  - We wanted flexibility and cost savings whenever possible, not relying on proprietary software to have the feature we want, but instead having the ability to, with a little time, add it ourselves.
- We felt compelled to use our tallents to serve the local church, and this is one way we can do that.


## Development

We gladly accept pull requests and issues. If you are interested in contributing, please do!

### Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. In another terminal, go into the `frontend`
directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend dev server will run on http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in your
browser and connect to your application.

### Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
